# AWS SDK Guidelines

## Overview

The AWS SDK is a library that provides a simple interface for interacting with AWS services. It is used to interact with AWS services such as S3, SQS, SNS, etc.

## Rules

- Always use the service client classes to interact with AWS services, rather than the SDK class.
